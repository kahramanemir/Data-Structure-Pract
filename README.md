# Binary Search Tree, Hash Table, and Min Heap

## 📌 About the Project
This project utilizes **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, **Hash Table**, and **Min Heap** data structures. The program stores cities and related information for specific regions and allows various operations through these data structures.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for inserting, in-order traversal, and balancing

✅ **Hash Table** for storing and updating data

✅ **Min Heap** for retrieving data in ascending order

✅ **Listing regions between two letters**

✅ **Balancing the tree**

✅ **Sorting using the Bubble Sort algorithm**

## ⚡ Usage
The project operates through a menu system, allowing the user to perform the following operations:

1️⃣ **Print the tree and its details**  
2️⃣ **List regions between two letters**  
3️⃣ **Create a balanced tree**  
4️⃣ **Print Hash Table contents**  
5️⃣ **Update an entry in the Hash Table**  
6️⃣ **Print the Heap structure**  
7️⃣ **Extract 3 elements from the Heap**  
8️⃣ **Sort using Bubble Sort**  

## 🛠 Installation and Execution

1️⃣ **Clone the project:**
